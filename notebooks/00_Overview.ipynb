    "- Users may unknowingly send funds to **known scam addresses**  \n",
    "- The provider takes on **reputational and compliance risk**  \n",

    "\n",
    "Across notebooks we evaluate three scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random address split (i.i.d.)**  \n",
    "   - Train / validate / test on addresses drawn from the **same global time span**.  \n",
    "   - No address appears in more than one split.  \n",
    "   - This is the **ceiling**: no time drift, clean separation of splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time-based split (past → future)**  \n",
    "   - Choose a time cutoff (e.g., 80th percentile of timestamps).  \n",
    "   - Train / validate on addresses built from **earlier transactions**;  \n",
    "     test on addresses built from **later transactions**.  \n",
    "   - Same feature recipe in each window.  \n",
    "   - Closer to **deployment reality** with concept drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **External DFPI evaluation**  \n",
    "   - Train a tuned model on the **benchmark random-split setting**.  \n",
    "   - Apply it **without retraining** to the DFPI scam-wallet dataset.  \n",
